# Test Drive: agent-sessions-warmup merge validation

**Date**: 2026-04-15
**Goal**: Validate the agent-sessions-warmup branch after merging main (18+ commits behind)
**Test Repo**: /tmp/f1-test-drive-1776296116
**Branch**: cypack-1086 (based on agent-sessions-warmup + main merge)

## Verification Results

### Issue-Tracker
- [x] Issue created (DEF-1)
- [x] Issue ID returned (issue-1)
- [x] Issue metadata accessible

- [x] Activities tracked (35 activities total)
- [x] Agent processed issue successfully
- [x] Repository selection elicitation worked correctly

### Renderer
- [x] Activity format correct (thought, action, elicitation, prompt types all present)
- [x] Pagination works (--offset flag verified)
- [x] Session log generated (JSONL + Markdown)

### Agent Output Quality
- [x] SlidingWindowRateLimiter implemented correctly
- [x] TypeScript types used properly (SlidingWindowConfig imported)
- [x] Type checking passed (npx tsc --noEmit)
- [x] Code committed on branch def-1-implement-sliding-window-rate
- [x] Final summary activity posted with clear description

## Session Log

```
# Phase 1: Setup
./f1 init-test-repo --path /tmp/f1-test-drive-1776296116  # OK
CYRUS_PORT=3600 CYRUS_REPO_PATH=/tmp/f1-test-drive-1776296116 bun run server.ts  # OK
CYRUS_PORT=3600 ./f1 ping  # OK

# Phase 2: Issue Creation
CYRUS_PORT=3600 ./f1 create-issue --title "Implement sliding window rate limiter algorithm"  # OK, issue-1/DEF-1

# Phase 3: Session
CYRUS_PORT=3600 ./f1 start-session --issue-id issue-1  # OK, session-1
# Elicitation: repo selection prompt appeared
CYRUS_PORT=3600 ./f1 prompt-session --session-id session-1 --message "/tmp/f1-test-drive-1776296116"  # OK

# Phase 4: Monitoring
# 35 activities generated over ~94 seconds

# Actions: Skill, Read, Edit, Bash, Glob
# Session completed with summary

# Session stats: Duration 94217ms, Cost $0.39
```

## Merge Context

Before the test drive, main was merged into the agent-sessions-warmup branch:
- Resolved 2 merge conflicts:
  1. `packages/edge-worker/package.json` — fastify version bump (took main's ^5.8.5)
  2. `packages/edge-worker/src/McpConfigService.ts` — took main's early-return refactor, then fixed `linearToken` type to accept `string | null`
- Build, typecheck, and lint all passed after merge

## Notes

- First attempt failed with "Not logged in" error because CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN was not set. Restarting the server with the token resolved this.
- Repository selection elicitation is always triggered in F1 mode (expected behavior for CLI platform).
- The session completed successfully but the server process appeared to exit after session completion — activities stopped being emitted after activity 35, though the session log shows completion at 23:39:03.

## Final Retrospective

**Passed**: The agent-sessions-warmup branch with main merged works end-to-end. The full pipeline (issue creation, routing, worktree creation, Claude session, activity tracking, code implementation, commit, summary) functions correctly.

**Issue observed**: Activity streaming may have stopped before the final response/summary activities were posted to the in-memory tracker. The session log (Markdown) shows the full completion, but `view-session` only captured 35 of what appears to be ~40+ activities. This could be a timing issue with the server process lifecycle.

**Recommendation**: The branch is ready for further testing or PR creation.
