# Test Drive: Orchestrator Sub-Issue Result Writing Fix (CYPACK-922)

**Date**: 2026-03-10
**Goal**: Verify the fix that ensures child session results are written back to the parent orchestrator session when a sub-issue completes.
**Branch**: cypack-922

---

## Summary of the Bug and Fix

### Bug Description

In `EdgeWorker.ts`, when a child session is created via `handleChildSessionMapping()`, the parent-child relationship was stored in `this.childToParentAgentSession` (a local `Map<string, string>`). However, when the child session completed, `AgentSessionManager`'s lookup path used `this.globalSessionRegistry.getParentSessionId(childSessionId)` — which searched a **different** registry that was never populated by `handleChildSessionMapping`.

Result: the lookup always returned `undefined`, so the child's result was never written back to the parent issue.

### Fix Applied

Two changes in `packages/edge-worker/src/EdgeWorker.ts`:

**1. In `handleChildSessionMapping()` (new session creation)**:
```typescript
this.childToParentAgentSession.set(childSessionId, parentSessionId);
// NEW: Also register in GlobalSessionRegistry so AgentSessionManager's
// getParentSessionId callback can find the parent when the child completes.
// Without this, child session results are never written back to the parent.
this.globalSessionRegistry.setParentSession(
    childSessionId,
    parentSessionId,
);
```

**2. In state restoration (serialization restore path)**:
```typescript
this.childToParentAgentSession = new Map(
    Object.entries(state.childToParentAgentSession),
);
// NEW: Sync to GlobalSessionRegistry so AgentSessionManager callbacks work
for (const [childId, parentId] of this.childToParentAgentSession) {
    this.globalSessionRegistry.setParentSession(childId, parentId);
}
```

## Test Environment

- **Port**: 3700
- **Repo Path**: `/Users/agentops/.cyrus/worktrees/CYPACK-922`
- **F1 Cyrus Home**: `/var/folders/xv/c55x22nd6lv8kq9fccch04d40000gp/T/cyrus-f1-1773151797568`

## Verification Results

### Phase 1: Build

- [x] `pnpm build` succeeded across all packages with zero errors

### Phase 2: Server startup

- [x] Server started on port 3700 (with `CLAUDECODE=` unset to allow nested Claude Code sessions)
- [x] `./f1 ping` returned healthy

> **Note**: First server start attempt failed because the parent process had `CLAUDECODE=1` set. Claude Code refuses to launch inside another Claude Code session unless `CLAUDECODE` is unset. Restarting the server with `CLAUDECODE=` fixed this.

### Phase 3: Orchestrator Session

- [x] Issue created: `DEF-1` (`issue-1`) with `orchestrator` label
- [x] Session started: `session-1`
- [x] Session recognized as `orchestrator-full` procedure immediately

### Phase 4: Key Observations

**The orchestrator did NOT create sub-issues in this test run.**

The F1 CLI issue tracker (`CLIIssueTrackerService`) lacks the `mcp__linear__create_issue` Linear MCP tool. The cyrus-tools MCP (`linear_agent_session_create`) was connected but the orchestrator needed `mcp__linear__create_issue` to create a Linear sub-issue first — which wasn't available. Claude adapted and solved the task directly instead of creating a sub-issue.

This means the specific orchestrator→child→parent result-write-back path was **not exercised end-to-end** in this test drive.

### Phase 5: Code-Level Verification

Despite the end-to-end path not being triggered, the fix was verified through code inspection:

**`handleChildSessionMapping` (lines 4303-4321 in `EdgeWorker.ts`)**:
```typescript
private handleChildSessionMapping(
    childSessionId: string,
    parentSessionId: string,
): void {
    this.childToParentAgentSession.set(childSessionId, parentSessionId);
    // Also register in GlobalSessionRegistry so AgentSessionManager's
    // getParentSessionId callback can find the parent when the child completes.
    // Without this, child session results are never written back to the parent.
    this.globalSessionRegistry.setParentSession(
        childSessionId,
        parentSessionId,
    );
}
```

**AgentSessionManager callback (lines 363-374 in `EdgeWorker.ts`)**:
```typescript
const agentSessionManager = new AgentSessionManager(
    activitySink,
    (childSessionId: string) => {
        const parentId =
            this.globalSessionRegistry.getParentSessionId(childSessionId);
        return parentId;  // Now correctly returns parent ID after fix
    },
    ...
);
```

The lookup path (`globalSessionRegistry.getParentSessionId`) and the write path (`globalSessionRegistry.setParentSession`) now use the same registry, closing the bug.

### Phase 6: Session Completion Flow

Server log confirms:
```
[INFO ] [EdgeWorker] {session=session-} Handling subroutine completion for session session-1
[INFO ] [EdgeWorker] {session=session-} Next subroutine: concise-summary
[INFO ] [EdgeWorker] {session=session-, platform=linear, issue=DEF-1} MCP tools disabled for session session-1 (disallowAllTools=true)
[INFO ] [AgentSessionManager] {session=session-, platform=linear, issue=DEF-1} All subroutines completed, posting final result to Linear
[INFO ] [AgentSessionManager] {session=session-, platform=linear, issue=DEF-1} Result message emitted to Linear (activity activity-39)
```

The single-session (no sub-issue) flow completed correctly, with the result properly posted as `activity-39`.

## Issues Encountered

### 1. `CLAUDECODE=1` Nested Session Error

**Problem**: When running the F1 server from within a Claude Code session, `CLAUDECODE=1` is inherited by the server process. Claude Code refuses to launch inside another Claude Code session.

**Resolution**: Started the server with `CLAUDECODE=` unset:
```bash
CLAUDECODE= CYRUS_PORT=3700 CYRUS_REPO_PATH=... bun run apps/f1/server.ts
```

**Recommendation**: Consider having the F1 server or `ClaudeRunner` automatically unset `CLAUDECODE` when spawning child Claude processes, since nested sessions are a common pattern when running F1 from within Cyrus itself.

### 2. Orchestrator Did Not Create Sub-Issues

**Problem**: The orchestrator task description asked it to "create a sub-issue", but the F1 environment lacks the Linear MCP (`mcp__linear__create_issue`). The orchestrator adapted and solved the task directly.

**Implication**: The parent-child result write-back path cannot be end-to-end tested in pure F1 CLI mode without the Linear MCP.

**Recommendation**: For full end-to-end orchestrator child-result testing, either:
1. Run against a real Linear workspace with Linear MCP configured, or
2. Add a mock `mcp__linear__create_issue` tool to the F1 CLI tracker that simulates sub-issue creation and triggers `linear_agent_session_create`.

## Final Retrospective

### What Worked
- Build succeeded cleanly
- Server started and handled sessions correctly
- Orchestrator procedure selection worked via label routing
- MCP tools (cyrus-tools) connected correctly
- Session lifecycle (primary + concise-summary subroutines) completed as expected
- Final result posted to the activity tracker

### Fix Assessment
The code-level fix is **logically correct** and **complete**:
- It addresses the root cause: `handleChildSessionMapping` now writes to both `childToParentAgentSession` AND `globalSessionRegistry`
- It also covers the state restore path so persistence doesn't re-introduce the bug
- The `AgentSessionManager`'s callback now has a correct parent lookup path

The fix closes the circuit between:
- **Write path**: `onSessionCreated` callback → `handleChildSessionMapping` → `globalSessionRegistry.setParentSession()`
- **Read path**: `AgentSessionManager` on child completion → `globalSessionRegistry.getParentSessionId()`

### Pass/Fail Status

**PASS** - with caveat.

The core session lifecycle is healthy, the fix is correct and in place, and all observable behaviors match expectations. The end-to-end child→parent result write path was not exercised due to the F1 environment not having Linear MCP for sub-issue creation — but this is an F1 environment limitation, not a product defect.
