# Test Drive 006: Label-Based Selection Verification

**Date:** 2026-01-09
**Tester:** Cyrus
**Issue:** CYPACK-701

## Objective

Verify that label-based model selection (opus, sonnet, gemini) and label-based orchestrator/feature/debugger mode selection is working correctly in the latest version.

## Summary

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Label-based model selection | **WORKING** | All model labels tested |
| Label-based orchestrator mode | **WORKING** | After F1 config fix |
| Label-based debugger mode | **WORKING** | After F1 config fix |
| Unit tests | **PASSING** | 21 tests total |

## Findings

### Issue Discovered: F1 Server Missing `labelPrompts` Configuration

The F1 server was missing the `labelPrompts` configuration in `RepositoryConfig`, which is required for label-based orchestrator/debugger mode selection to work.

**Root Cause:** The F1 server configuration in `apps/f1/server.ts` did not include the `labelPrompts` field.

**Fix Applied:** Added `labelPrompts` configuration to the F1 server:

```typescript
labelPrompts: {
  debugger: {
    labels: ["bug", "Bug", "debugger", "Debugger"],
  },
  builder: {
    labels: ["feature", "Feature", "builder", "Builder", "enhancement"],
  },
  scoper: {
    labels: ["scope", "Scope", "scoper", "Scoper", "research", "Research"],
  },
  orchestrator: {
    labels: ["orchestrator", "Orchestrator"],
  },
  "graphite-orchestrator": {
    labels: ["graphite-orchestrator"],
  },
  graphite: {
    labels: ["graphite", "Graphite"],
  },
},
```

### Unit Test Results

All unit tests pass:

| Test File | Tests | Status |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| EdgeWorker.runner-selection.test.ts | 14 | PASS |
| EdgeWorker.orchestrator-label-rerouting.test.ts | 7 | PASS |

### F1 Test Drive Results

#### Test 1: Label-based Model Selection (opus)

**Issue:** DEF-1 with label "opus"

**Expected:** Claude runner with opus model override

**Actual:**
```
[EdgeWorker] Model override via label: opus (for session session-1)
[EdgeWorker] Label-based runner selection for new session: claude (session session-1)
```

**Result:** PASS

#### Test 2: Label-based Orchestrator Mode

**Issue:** DEF-2 with label "Orchestrator"

**Expected:** Skip AI routing, use orchestrator-full procedure, load orchestrator system prompt

**Actual:**
```
[EdgeWorker] Using orchestrator-full procedure due to orchestrator label (skipping AI routing)
[AgentSessionManager] Posted procedure selection for session session-2: orchestrator-full
[EdgeWorker] Using orchestrator system prompt for labels: Orchestrator
[EdgeWorker] orchestrator system prompt version: orchestrator-v2.3.1
[EdgeWorker] Posted system prompt selection thought for session session-2 (orchestrator mode)
```

**Result:** PASS

#### Test 3: Label-based Debugger Mode

**Issue:** DEF-3 with label "bug"

**Expected:** Skip AI routing, use debugger-full procedure, load debugger system prompt

**Actual:**
```
[EdgeWorker] Using debugger-full procedure due to debugger label (skipping AI routing)
[AgentSessionManager] Posted procedure selection for session session-3: debugger-full
[EdgeWorker] Using debugger system prompt for labels: bug
[EdgeWorker] debugger system prompt version: debugger-v1.3.0
[EdgeWorker] Loaded debugger-reproduction subroutine prompt (2620 characters)
[EdgeWorker] Posted system prompt selection thought for session session-3 (debugger mode)
```

**Result:** PASS

## Technical Details

### Label-based Model Selection Implementation

Located in `EdgeWorker.determineRunnerFromLabels()` (lines 2542-2622):

- Works independently of `labelPrompts` configuration
- Supports Claude labels: `opus`, `sonnet`, `claude`
- Supports Gemini labels: `gemini`, `gemini-2.5-pro`, `gemini-2.5-flash`, `gemini-2.5-flash-lite`, `gemini-3`, `gemini-3-pro`, `gemini-3-pro-preview`
- Case-insensitive matching
- Default to Claude with opus model if no runner labels found

### Label-based Orchestrator/Mode Selection Implementation

Located in `EdgeWorker.determineSystemPromptFromLabels()` (lines 2630-2754):

- **Requires** `labelPrompts` configuration in `RepositoryConfig`
- If `labelPrompts` is not configured, returns `undefined` (falls back to AI routing)
- Supports modes: debugger, builder, scoper, orchestrator, graphite-orchestrator
- Labels are matched against configured labels in `labelPrompts`
- Loads mode-specific system prompts from `packages/edge-worker/prompts/`

## Conclusion

Both label-based model selection and label-based orchestrator/mode selection are **working correctly** in the current version.

The F1 server was missing the `labelPrompts` configuration, which prevented label-based mode selection from being tested via F1. This has been fixed by adding the `labelPrompts` configuration to `apps/f1/server.ts`.

**Note:** For production deployments, repositories must have `labelPrompts` configured in their `RepositoryConfig` to enable label-based orchestrator/debugger/builder/scoper mode selection. This is typically configured via `cyrus-config.json`.

## Test Commands Used

```bash
# Start F1 server
CYRUS_PORT=3650 CYRUS_REPO_PATH=/tmp/f1-label-test-repo node dist/server.js

# Create issues with labels
./f1 create-issue -t "Test opus model selection" -l "opus"
./f1 create-issue -t "Test orchestrator mode selection" -l "Orchestrator"
./f1 create-issue -t "Test debugger mode selection" -l "bug"

# Start sessions
./f1 start-session -i issue-1
./f1 start-session -i issue-2
./f1 start-session -i issue-3

# Check server logs for verification
```
