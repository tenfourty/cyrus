# Test Drive: Sandbox SDK Proxy Interception Verification

**Date**: 2026-04-14
**Goal**: Verify that sandbox settings are passed via SDK (not settings.json) and that the egress proxy intercepts Bash-spawned subprocess traffic (git/gh).
**Test Repo**: `/tmp/f1-sandbox-proxy-test-1776130730`
**Branch**: `cypack-1066`

## Session Log

### Phase 1: Setup

```
$ cd apps/f1 && ./f1 init-test-repo --path /tmp/f1-sandbox-proxy-test-1776130730
✓ Test repository created successfully at /tmp/f1-sandbox-proxy-test-1776130730
```

Server started with `CYRUS_SANDBOX=1`:

```
$ CYRUS_PORT=3600 CYRUS_REPO_PATH=/tmp/f1-sandbox-proxy-test-1776130730 CYRUS_SANDBOX=1 bun run apps/f1/server.ts
```

Key startup log entries:

```
[INFO ] [EdgeWorker] Generating CA certificate for egress proxy TLS termination...
[INFO ] [EdgeWorker] CA certificate written to .../cyrus-f1-.../certs/cyrus-egress-ca.pem
[INFO ] [EdgeWorker] Egress proxy started (HTTP: 19080, SOCKS: 19081)
```

The proxy started successfully. Settings were passed via the SDK `sandbox` option
(not via `~/.claude/settings.json`), as confirmed by:
- No `settings.json` write in server startup logs
- `sdkSandboxSettings` built in `EdgeWorker.start()` and passed per-session to ClaudeRunner

### Phase 2: Issue + Session

```
$ CYRUS_PORT=3600 ./f1 create-issue --title "Add a .gitignore file..." --description "..."
✓ Issue created: issue-1 (DEF-1)

$ CYRUS_PORT=3600 ./f1 start-session --issue-id issue-1
✓ Session started: session-1

# Repository selection elicitation (single-repo F1 setup)
$ CYRUS_PORT=3600 ./f1 prompt-session --session-id session-1 --message "F1 Test Repository"
✓ Message sent successfully
```

Session routed successfully after user selection.

### Phase 3: Proxy Log Observation

Claude ran the following git/gh Bash commands during the session:

| Time        | Command                | Network call? |
|-------------|------------------------|---------------|
| 6:39:57 PM  | `git status`           | No (local)    |
| 6:40:01 PM  | `git push` (Error)     | No (no remote)|
| 6:40:04 PM  | `git remote -v`        | No (local)    |
| 6:40:06 PM  | `git log --oneline`    | No (local)    |

**Proxy log entries for the Claude session: NONE.**

However, a manual curl through the proxy immediately generated `[PROXY]` entries:

```
2026-04-14T01:45:28.207Z [INFO ] [EdgeWorker] [PROXY] HTTP GET example.com/
2026-04-14T01:45:30.841Z [INFO ] [EdgeWorker] [PROXY] HTTP GET httpbin.org/get
```

This confirms the proxy is functional and logging correctly.

### Phase 4: Root Cause Analysis

**Why no proxy entries for git traffic:**

1. **The proxy is working.** Manual HTTP traffic through port 19080 is intercepted and logged correctly with `[PROXY]` tag.

2. **SDK sandbox settings flow correctly.** The `sdkSandboxSettings` object is built at proxy startup (`EdgeWorker.start()`), stored on the EdgeWorker instance, and passed per-session via `RunnerConfigBuilder.buildSessionConfig()` → ClaudeRunner → SDK `query()` options. The SDK schema `SandboxSettings.network.httpProxyPort/socksProxyPort` matches what we pass.

3. **macOS sandbox uses `sandbox-exec`, which IS supported.** Code analysis of the Claude SDK CLI bundle confirms:
   - `isSupportedPlatform()` (`D94()`) returns `true` for macOS
   - On macOS, `sandbox-exec -p <profile>` wraps each Bash command
   - `uT8(httpProxyPort, socksProxyPort)` injects `HTTP_PROXY=http://localhost:19080` and `HTTPS_PROXY=http://localhost:19080` into the subprocess environment

4. **The git commands in this session made no network calls.**
   - `git status`, `git remote -v`, `git log` are purely local operations
   - `git push` failed instantly with `fatal: 'origin' does not appear to be a git repository` — the F1 test repo has no remote configured, so git rejected the command before making any network connection
   - There were no HTTPS-based git remotes that would route through `HTTP_PROXY`

5. **SSH-based git traffic would NOT go through the HTTP proxy anyway.** Even if a remote existed, if it were SSH-based (git@github.com:...), SSH uses TCP directly and does not honor `HTTP_PROXY`. Only HTTPS-based remotes honor the proxy.

**Conclusion:** The sandbox SDK path is wired correctly. To observe proxy interception, a future test drive should use a repo with an HTTPS remote (e.g., `https://github.com/...`) so that `git push` / `git fetch` make actual HTTPS connections routed through the proxy. The current F1 test repo setup (no remote) makes it impossible to observe network proxy interception for git traffic.

## Final Retrospective

### What worked

- Proxy startup via `CYRUS_SANDBOX=1` is clean and fast (CA cert generation in ~54ms)
- SDK sandbox settings are correctly passed per-session, not via `settings.json` mutation
- The proxy IS intercepting HTTP traffic (verified via manual curl)
- macOS sandbox is supported (`sandbox-exec` path)
- Session completed successfully (42 messages) with git commands executed
- Shutdown was graceful: `Egress proxy stopped` logged on SIGTERM

### What didn't appear

- `[TUNNEL]`, `[MITM]`, `[BLOCKED]`, or `[PROXY]` log entries during the Claude session
- This is expected given the root cause above (no network-bound git calls)

### Issues found

- **The F1 test repo has no git remote**, making it structurally unable to exercise proxy interception for git traffic. This is by design (F1 is self-contained), but it means this particular goal (intercepting git/gh network traffic) cannot be validated with the default F1 setup.

### Recommendations

1. **Add an HTTPS git remote to the F1 test repo scaffold** — even a fake one pointing at `https://github.com/f1-test/primary-repo` — so `git push` makes an HTTPS connection that routes through the proxy before failing with auth error.

2. **Add a `stderr` callback in ClaudeRunner** to capture the Claude CLI sandbox warning/confirmation message. Currently, the sandbox activation/deactivation warning from the CLI is silently discarded. Capturing it would make sandbox status visible in server logs.

3. **Future test drive for proxy interception**: Use `CYRUS_SANDBOX_POLICY=1` with a real or reachable HTTPS remote so that `git fetch` produces a `[TUNNEL]` or `[BLOCKED]` log entry.

4. **Consider a smoke test endpoint** in EgressProxy that logs when the first subprocess routes through it, independent of git remote configuration.

### Pass/Fail

**PARTIAL PASS**: The sandbox settings flow via SDK is confirmed working. The proxy starts, logs, and intercepts HTTP traffic correctly. The absence of proxy log entries during the session is explained by no network-bound git operations occurring (no remote configured). The core objective of verifying SDK-based settings propagation is met.
