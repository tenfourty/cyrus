# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Real-time streaming updates to Linear comments during Claude Code execution
  - Agent now immediately posts "Getting to work..." comment when starting a new session
  - This initial comment is updated in real-time with progress synthesis as Claude executes
  - Shows tool calls performed and current focus of the agent
  - Final response is posted as a separate comment when Claude completes
  - When no final content is available, posts helpful message directing users to last progress update
  - Fixed timing issues where streaming comments were created after Claude process started
  - Added throttling (2 second minimum interval) to prevent overwhelming Linear's API
  - Improved logging and error handling for streaming comment updates
- Version flag support for linear-claude-agent executable
  - Added `--version` and `-v` command line flags to display current version
  - Version information is automatically read from package.json
  - Updated help text to include version option
- Vitest as the new test runner, replacing Jest
  - Provides significantly faster test execution
  - Maintains full compatibility with existing test APIs
  - Includes built-in UI mode for test debugging with `pnpm run test:ui`
  - Native ES modules support without experimental flags
- Coverage folder to .gitignore to prevent test coverage reports from being tracked
- AttachmentDownloader class to handle all types of Linear attachments (not just images)
  - Supports downloading any file type from Linear's authenticated storage
  - Automatically detects file types and categorizes them as images or other attachments
  - Gracefully handles download failures with informative warnings
  - Replaces the previous ImageDownloader with a more comprehensive solution
- Threaded comment reply support in Linear
  - Agent now creates proper threaded replies when responding to specific comments

### Fixed
- Issue state selection when moving assigned issues to 'In Progress'
  - Now correctly selects the 'started' state with the lowest position when multiple 'started' states exist
  - Ensures issues move to "In Progress" rather than "In Review" when both have type 'started'
  - Addresses CEA-54 where issues were incorrectly moving to higher-positioned started states
- Enhanced threading behavior for Linear comments
  - Agent's first assignment comment is always a top-level comment
  - All subsequent agent messages are threaded under the first comment
  - When users comment, agent replies directly to their comments
- Comment threading issues with Linear API
  - Fixed session initialization to properly pass agentRootCommentId to Session constructor
  - Fixed nested reply threading logic to find correct root comment ID when replying to threaded comments
  - Ensures compliance with Linear API requirement that parentId must be a top-level comment
  - Addresses CEA-57 threading scenarios: assignment response threading and nested reply errors
  - When replying in existing threads, agent uses the same parentId to maintain thread structure
  - Session tracking for agentRootCommentId and currentParentId
  - Tracks parent comment IDs from webhook notifications
  - Replies to comments are posted as threaded replies maintaining conversation context
  - New top-level comments are created for unrelated responses
  - Comprehensive test suite for all threading scenarios

### Removed
- Jest test runner and related dependencies (@types/jest, jest-environment-node)
- Jest configuration file (jest.config.mjs)
- Coverage folder from git tracking (now properly ignored)
- ImageDownloader class (replaced by AttachmentDownloader)
  - All image handling functionality is now provided by AttachmentDownloader
  - Removed ImageDownloader tests, exports, and container registration

### Changed
- Migrated from npm to pnpm package manager
  - Replaced package-lock.json with pnpm-lock.yaml
  - Updated all documentation to use pnpm commands
  - Updated GitHub Actions workflow to use pnpm
  - Added `packageManager` field to package.json for explicit pnpm version (10.11.0)
- Renamed and simplified GitHub Actions workflow
  - Renamed `tests.yml` to `ci.yml` to better reflect its purpose
  - Simplified workflow configuration for clarity
  - Updated badge reference in README.md
  - Switched to `wyvox/action-setup-pnpm` for consistent dependency installation
  - Added Node.js 22.x to the test matrix
  - Refactored dependency installation into a reusable GitHub Action
- Test runner from Jest to Vitest for improved performance
  - All test files updated to import from 'vitest' instead of '@jest/globals'
  - Mock functions migrated from `jest.*` to `vi.*` equivalents
  - Updated package.json test scripts to use vitest commands
  - Created vitest.config.mjs with minimal configuration using defaults
- Automatic state transition to "started" state when issues are assigned to the agent
  - Issues now automatically move to "started" state type upon agent assignment
  - Uses Linear's standardized state types (triage, backlog, unstarted, started, completed, canceled) instead of matching state names
  - Works consistently across all teams regardless of custom state naming
  - Gracefully continues processing even if state transition fails
  - Provides clear logging of state transitions for debugging
  - Respects workspace settings for branch naming conventions
  - Falls back to lowercase identifier if API value not available
- All entry points now support custom environment file paths
- Updated documentation to reflect new environment file behavior
- NodeClaudeService now downloads images before starting Claude sessions
- Fresh sessions after token limit also include previously downloaded images
- Agent now has better social awareness when reading Linear comments 🎭
  - Only responds to comments without @ mentions (general conversation)
  - Always responds when directly @ mentioned (someone needs the agent!)
  - Politely ignores when other users are @ mentioned but not the agent (respecting private conversations)
- Image storage location moved from project directory to home directory
  - Images are now stored in `~/.linearsecretagent/<workspace>/images` instead of `.linear-images` in project
  - Prevents workspace pollution and eliminates need to update `.gitignore`
  - Follows same pattern as conversation history storage
- Image file type detection from content
  - Automatically detects actual file type (png, jpg, gif, etc.) from downloaded content
  - No longer relies on URL extensions which Linear doesn't provide
  - Falls back to .png if file type cannot be determined

### Fixed
- Agent now correctly identifies itself using its Linear username instead of "Claude"
  - Prompt template now uses dynamic `{{agent_name}}` placeholder
  - Agent name is fetched from Linear API and injected into prompts
  - Fallback to "Linear Agent" if username is not available
- Fixed issue where all attachments were treated as images
  - Non-image attachments (like .jsonl files) no longer cause "Could not process image" errors
  - Attachment failures are now handled gracefully without stopping the agent
- Fixed nested reply handling to comply with Linear API requirements
  - When agent is mentioned in nested comments (replies to replies), the system now correctly finds the root comment of the thread
  - Linear API requires parentId to point to a top-level comment, not another nested comment
  - Added `findRootCommentId()` method to traverse comment hierarchies and locate thread roots
  - Updated `handleAgentMention`, `handleAgentReply`, and `handleCommentEvent` to use root comment IDs for threading
  - Prevents "Parent comment must be a top level comment" errors when replying to deeply nested comments
