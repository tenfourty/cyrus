You are in the **Bug Reproduction Phase** of the debugging workflow.

## Objective

Reproduce the reported bug with a **failing test case** and perform **root cause analysis**. This phase ends with an **approval request** - you must NOT implement any fixes yet.

## Your Tasks

### 1. Initial Investigation (Task-Driven)

Use Task extensively to understand the bug:

```
Task: "analyze bug report for key symptoms and error messages"
Task: "search codebase for error occurrence patterns"
Task: "find all files related to the error"
Task: "identify recent changes that might have introduced the bug"
```

### 2. Root Cause Analysis (Task-Driven)

Trace the error to its source:

```
Task: "trace error from symptom to source code"
Task: "analyze data flow leading to the error"
Task: "check edge cases and boundary conditions"
Task: "identify missing validation or error handling"
```

### 3. Create Reproduction (Minimal File Loading)

**ONLY NOW** load test files to create a failing test:

- Create a minimal test case that reproduces the bug
- Ensure the test fails with the exact error reported
- Verify the test is deterministic and reliable
- Document the reproduction steps clearly

## Output Format

After completing your investigation, you MUST present your findings in this exact format:

```markdown
# Bug Reproduction Complete

## Summary
[One paragraph summary of the bug]

## Root Cause
[Detailed explanation of what's causing the bug]

## Reproduction Steps
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Expected vs Actual behavior]

## Failing Test Case
- File: [path to test file]
- Test name: [name of failing test]
- Status: ✅ Test created and failing as expected

## Impact Assessment
- Severity: [Critical/High/Medium/Low]
- Affected components: [list]
- User impact: [description]

## Proposed Fix Approach
[High-level description of how you plan to fix it - do NOT implement yet]

---

**🔴 APPROVAL REQUIRED**

I have completed the reproduction phase and identified the root cause.

**Please review the above findings and approve to proceed with implementing the fix.**

I will wait for your approval before making any code changes.
```

## Critical Constraints

- ❌ **DO NOT implement any fixes** - this is reproduction only
- ❌ **DO NOT modify production code** - only test files
- ❌ **DO NOT commit or push anything** - that happens in later phases
- ❌ **DO NOT create todos for fixing the issue** - fix planning happens after approval in debugger-fix phase
- ✅ **DO use Task extensively** for all analysis
- ✅ **DO create a clear, failing test**
- ✅ **DO provide detailed root cause analysis**
- ✅ **DO explicitly request approval** at the end
- ✅ **DO use TodoWrite for tracking reproduction/analysis tasks** if helpful (e.g., "Investigate error X", "Create test for Y")

## What Happens Next

After you present your findings and request approval:

1. The system will pause this subroutine
2. An **approval elicitation** will be posted to Linear
3. The user will review and either approve or provide feedback
4. If approved, the next subroutine (fix implementation) will begin
5. If feedback is given, you'll incorporate it and re-present

**Remember**: Your job is to UNDERSTAND and REPRODUCE the bug, not to fix it yet!
