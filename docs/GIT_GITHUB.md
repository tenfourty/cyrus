# Git & GitHub Setup

Cyrus uses your local Git and GitHub CLI (`gh`) authentication to create commits and pull requests. This guide explains how to configure these tools and what permissions Cyrus will have.

---

## Understanding Permissions

**Important:** Cyrus operates with the same permissions as your authenticated Git and GitHub CLI user.

When Cyrus creates commits and PRs:
- All commits are attributed to your Git user (`git config user.name` and `user.email`)
- All PRs are created under your GitHub account
- Your repository access permissions apply to all operations
- The only indication that Claude assisted is the "Co-Authored-By" commit trailer

This means Cyrus can access any repository your authenticated user can access. Configure authentication carefully based on what repositories you want Cyrus to work with.

## Git Configuration

Configure Git with your identity:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

### SSH Authentication (Recommended)

Set up SSH keys for Git operations:

```bash
# Generate SSH key (if you don't have one)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your.email@example.com"

# Start the SSH agent
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

# Add your key to the agent
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

# Copy the public key
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

Add the public key to your GitHub account at [github.com/settings/keys](https://github.com/settings/keys).

## GitHub CLI Setup

Install and authenticate the GitHub CLI for PR creation:

### Installation

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install gh
```

**Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):**
```bash
sudo apt install gh
```

**Other platforms:** See [cli.github.com](https://cli.github.com/)

### Authentication

```bash
gh auth login
```

Follow the prompts to authenticate. For servers without a browser, use a personal access token:

```bash
gh auth login --with-token < token.txt
```

### Verify Setup

```bash
# Check Git config
git config --global user.name
git config --global user.email

# Check GitHub CLI
gh auth status
```

## Security Considerations

- **Use a dedicated account** for Cyrus if you want to limit its access
- **Repository access** is determined by your SSH key and GitHub token permissions
- **Review permissions** before adding repositories to Cyrus
- **Audit commits** - all Cyrus commits include the "Co-Authored-By" trailer for traceability
